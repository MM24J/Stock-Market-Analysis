Module 2 Challenge
I ran this code on all 3 worksheets independently which worked. When I tried to run it on all 3 at the same time, it took a very long time, so I tested it on a small sample size, and it worked on all 3 worksheets.
I got assistance from a tutor to improve my code.
I found a similar project on github which helped me improve my code.
