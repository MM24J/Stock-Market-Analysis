Module 2 Challenge

I ran this code on all 3 worksheets independently which worked. When I tried to run it on all 3 at the same time, it took a very long time to run, so I tested it on a small sample size, and it worked on all 3 worksheets.

I got assistance from a tutor to improve my code.

I checked Stack Overflow to get help with running code on multiple worksheets and structuring formula for Yearly Change.

I consulted course material and Slack channel.
