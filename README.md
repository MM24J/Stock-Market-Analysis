# Stock Market Analysis

Background:

In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

NOTE:

Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
